# Nature Walkeer

**Nature Walkeer** is an Android application designed to encourage users to stay active by walking. The app tracks daily steps, converts them into coins, and allows users to use these coins to purchase in-app upgrades and plants. Users can activate boosts, care for plants, and participate in challenges. The app also includes features for user authentication and profile management.

## Features

### 1. Step Tracking
- **Real-Time Step Tracking**: The app tracks the user's steps throughout the day using Android's built-in step sensor. It updates the step count regularly when the app is in the foreground or background, ensuring that users receive coins for each step taken.
- **Daily and Weekly Step Goals**: Users can set daily step goals, and the app keeps track of weekly step counts, helping users to stay motivated and active.

### 2. In-App Currency
- **Coins for Steps**: Every step taken by the user earns them coins. These coins can be used to purchase virtual plants and upgrades within the app.
- **Boosts**: Users can activate boosts that multiply the number of coins earned per step for a limited time.

### 3. Virtual Plant Care
- **Plant Store**: Users can buy plants from a store using the coins theyâ€™ve earned.
- **Plant Care**: Users can plant their plants and grow them until they are ready to be harvested for additional rewards.

### 4. Firebase Integration
- **Firestore Database**: The app uses Firestore to store user data, including step counts, coins, and plant information. This allows for real-time data syncing across devices.
- **Firebase Authentication**: The app includes Firebase Authentication to manage user sign-up, login, and profile management securely. Users can sign in using email and password.
- **Firebase Storage**: The app utilizes Firebase Storage for handling most of the content, such as pictures or icons. These images are stored securely, and their URLs are saved in Firestore.

### 5. User Management
- **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit their profile information, including changing their password and profile picture.
- **Leaderboard**: The app includes a leaderboard feature that ranks users based on their current amount of coins.
